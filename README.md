# Comparative Analysis of Employee Attrition Factors at the companies IBM and ZIA (Python research project based on synthetic HR data)

This Python research project investigates the factors influencing employee attrition at two fictional companies, IBM and ZIA. The goal is to identify both common and unique drivers of employee turnover, with insights drawn from key variables such as overtime, marital status, job satisfaction, tenure, job level, remote work, and work-life balance. The study concludes with tailored recommendations for retention strategies, emphasizing the need to manage overtime, support single employees, and promote work-life balance through remote work options.

## Research Approach
This project employs a quantitative research approach to analyze attrition factors in two datasets, IBM and ZIA. Python is used to conduct the analysis, leveraging three key statistical methods:
- **Chi-Square Tests**: To assess associations between categorical variables.
- **Analysis of Variance (ANOVA)**: To identify significant differences across groups.
- **Logistic Regression**: To model the likelihood of employee attrition based on predictor variables.
These methods provide a comprehensive understanding of the factors contributing to employee turnover.

## Datasets
The datasets used in this project are sourced from Kaggle and contain synthetic data:
- IBM Dataset - (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/pavansubhasht/ibm-hr-analytics-attrition-dataset)  
- ZIA Dataset - (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/stealthtechnologies/employee-attrition-dataset?select=train.csv)

## Background
This project was developed as part of the SoftUni course "Data Science," which I completed in August 2024. In this training I learned how to use Python for Data Analysis. The course also included an introduction to Machine Learning and applying ML models like Linear and Logistic Regression. This research project served as my final course project and was evaluated with an excellent grade (6.00).

## Files
The repository contains the following files:

- **`AM_Project.ipynb`**: Jupyter Notebook containing the complete Python code for the project.
- **`IBM.csv`**: CSV file with synthetic employee attrition data for the company IBM.
- **`Zia.xlsx`**: Excel file with synthetic employee attrition data for the company ZIA.
